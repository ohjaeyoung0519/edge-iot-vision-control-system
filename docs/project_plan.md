# Project Plan

## Project Title

Edge IoT Vision & Control System

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build an edge IoT control system using a Raspberry Pi 5 and ESP32 boards.

The system is designed to support remote control, local hardware control, servo-based physical switching, sensor-based state checking, and future IR/camera-based device state recognition.

This project is not only focused on implementing basic IoT control, but also on measuring and analyzing communication latency, ESP32 memory usage, servo motor stability, external power behavior, and hardware reliability in an embedded edge system.

## System Concept

The Raspberry Pi 5 acts as a central edge control server.

ESP32 boards operate as wireless hardware control nodes. Each ESP32 node can be assigned to a specific physical control target, such as a light switch, PC power button, or IR-based device control.

The system follows this general control flow:

### Raspberry Pi Server Test

A Flask-based test server was implemented on the Raspberry Pi 5.

The server was accessed from a MacBook browser through the Raspberry Pi local IP address and port `5000`.

This confirmed the initial communication path:

MacBook Browser -> Local Wi-Fi Network -> Raspberry Pi Flask Server
```

### ESP32 Wi-Fi and HTTP Server Test

ESP32 was connected to Wi-Fi and configured as a simple HTTP server.

The ESP32 successfully responded to browser and Raspberry Pi requests through its local IP address.

### Raspberry Pi to ESP32 Latency Test

Raspberry Pi sent 100 repeated HTTP requests to the ESP32 `/api/ping` endpoint.

Measured summary:

- Total requests: 100
- Successful requests: 100
- Failed requests: 0
- Success rate: 100%
- Minimum latency: 82.42 ms
- Maximum latency: 126.07 ms
- Average latency: 114.017 ms
- Median latency: 114.56 ms

Raw and processed data are stored in:

MG90S servo motor and LDR sensor were tested using ESP32.

The MG90S servo motor was powered by an external 5V power supply, and ESP32 GND was connected to the external power GND as common ground.

- Temperature before test: 26.5°C
- Temperature after 5 minutes: 27.6°C
- Temperature after 10 minutes: 27.8°C
- Temperature increase after 10 minutes: +1.3°C

No ESP32 reset, servo failure, or overheating was observed during the test.

Raw and processed data are stored in:

data/processed/servo_ldr_measurement_10min_clean.csv

## Current Limitations

- The current servo test was performed without a real physical switch load.
- LDR sensor was tested under general lighting conditions, but PC power LED threshold testing is not complete yet.
- Local button input has not yet been integrated with the final ESP32 node code.
- IR control and camera-based state recognition are planned as extensions.
- Current ESP32 test sketches are separated by function and need to be integrated into a single node program.

2. Combine Wi-Fi, HTTP server, servo control, and LDR sensing.
3. Add ESP32 endpoints for servo and sensor control.

5. Test remote servo actuation through Raspberry Pi.
6. Measure end-to-end remote control latency.
7. Mount LDR sensor near the PC power LED.
8. Measure PC ON/OFF raw values and define threshold.
9. Add local tact switch input.
10. Prepare IR control and camera extension after the main control path is stable.
